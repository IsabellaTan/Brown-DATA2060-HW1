You will be asked to create a DATA2060 conda environment. We recommend that you use conda but if you are more familiar with other package managers (like docker, homebrew, poetry), feel free to use those. However, please note that the TAs might not be able to help if you do not use conda. The most important thing is to install the packages with their versions as shown in the data2060.yml file of the [course's github repository](https://github.com/BrownDSI/DATA2060-Fall2024). **Two points will be deducted for each failed test, and you'll receive -14 points if you do not run the cell below.**\n",

By the end of this assignment, you will have used numpy to perform efficient computations, loaded standard datasets using sklearn, and used matplotlib to visualize several performance metrics you will be using this semester. This homework will also get you familiar with the hand-in process for jupyter notebooks."

    "Answer the following questions using numpy functions. Note that when importing numpy, it is often abbreviated to np (i.e., `import numpy as np`), so when calling numpy functions, you can use np.\\[function\\]. Further, note that you may NOT use the np array constructor to solve these questions (i.e., `np.array(...)`). Some functions you may want to consider to approach this problem are `np.arange`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.eye`, `np.sum`, `np.hstack`, `np.vstack`, `np.transpose`, `np.matmul`, `np.inner`, `np.where` and `np.dot`.\n",
